# :sparkles: Capitalism In A Nutshell ( CIAN ) :sparkles:

> **Currently only supports UNIX-like operating systems (e.g., Linux, MacOS)**  
> ~~Windows support coming soon!~~

The aim is simple: buy every item.  
This can be achieved by getting a job, going to university, getting a better paying job so you will be able to achieve the end goal

## How to run the program

### Prerequisites
1. You will need a UNIX-like operating system. If you are using Windows or any non-POSIX-compliant machine, I am not sure whether the program will work.
2. Basic knowledge of ``bash`` and command line interfaces is assumed.
3. A C++ compiler is required to compile the source code manually. You can download ``g++`` [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/).

### Running the program
> ``g++`` is the assumed compiler in these steps. If you are using a different compiler, you will need to translate the instructions to commands your compiler can understand.

1. In your terminal, navigate to the folder containing the program's source code. An example would be:  
``cd Downloads/Capitalism-In-A-Nutshell-main``
  
2. Now that you're in the program's folder, you can access the files inside, including the ``main.cpp`` file. We will need to compile this using ``g++ main.cpp -std=c++11``. Optionally, you can name the compiled file by adding ``-o "<NAME HERE>"``. If you do not do this, the file name will default to ``a.out``  

3. The program's compiled, now all you need to do is run it. Simply type in ``./a.out``, replacing ``a.out`` with whatever you named the executable, or double-click the file in your GUI filesystem (E.g., Finder).
