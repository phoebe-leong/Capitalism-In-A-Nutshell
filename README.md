# Capitalism In A Nutshell

The aim is simple: buy every item.  
This can be achieved by getting a job, going to university, getting a better paying job, and then finally managing to buy every item.

Few things to note:  
- Once you get a job through the jobs menu, the program gives you fifteen times the amount of normal pay.
- Once you get a degree, the job associated with that degree gets automatically assigned to you.
- When entering the command to work, you can simply type the command as many times as you like on the same input line with a space in between each command.
